# Research

Primarily, my research examines how new accounting standards and regulations** shape firms’ and investors’ decisions. More broadly, I study financial institutions, risk management, and corporate governance**. I am also enthusiastic about applying new technologies—such as large language models (LLMs) and AI—to accounting research.

## Working Paper
**Who Enforces Matters: Evidence from Insider-Trading Cases**  
*Zihan (Zoe) Tang*  
We assemble a micro-level **case × team × defendant** dataset (2011–2024) from SEC Litigation Releases and linked biographical sources to study how frontline enforcement-team composition relates to nine defendant-level outcomes (civil and criminal). Using Elastic-Net screening with post-selection OLS and two-way clustering, preliminary patterns suggest professionally balanced teams (investigation, accounting/forensics, data, trial) are associated with stronger criminal channels (parallel actions, incarceration) and larger monetary relief, controlling for venue and scale of illegal gains.  
*Status:* preliminary; robustness and alternative specifications ongoing.
