More broadly, I study financial institutions, risk management, and corporate governance**. I am also enthusiastic about applying new technologies—such as large language models (LLMs) and AI—to accounting research.\n\n\nWho Enforces Matters: Evidence from Insider-Trading Cases\nZihan (Zoe) Tang\nWe assemble a micro-level case × team × defendant dataset (2011–2024) from SEC Litigation Releases and linked biographical sources to study how frontline enforcement-team composition relates to nine defendant-level outcomes (civil and criminal). Using Elastic-Net screening with post-selection OLS and two-way clustering, preliminary patterns suggest professionally balanced teams (investigation, accounting/forensics, data, trial) are associated with stronger criminal channels (parallel actions, incarceration) and larger monetary relief, controlling for venue and scale of illegal gains.\nStatus: preliminary; robustness and alternative specifications ongoing.\n\n\n\nSentiment Analysis on Inflation after COVID-19 (with Xinyu Li), Applied Economics and Finance, 10(1), 2023.\n\n\n\n\nGitHub profile: https://github.com/ZoeTang12\nReplication/teaching materials available upon request."
