# Zihan (Zoe) Tang
*PhD Student in Accounting, University of Minnesota — Carlson School of Management*

Primarily, my research examines how **new accounting standards and regulations** shape **firms’** and **investors’** decisions. More broadly, I study **financial institutions, risk management, and corporate governance**. I am also enthusiastic about applying **new technologies—such as large language models (LLMs) and AI—to accounting research**.
