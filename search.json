Using Elastic-Net screening with post-selection OLS and two-way clustering, preliminary patterns suggest professionally balanced teams (investigation, accounting/forensics, data, trial) are associated with stronger criminal channels (parallel actions, incarceration) and larger monetary relief, controlling for venue and scale of illegal gains.\nStatus: preliminary; robustness and alternative specifications ongoing."
